## Project Overview

SolarScape is a comprehensive geospatial analysis project focused on optimizing the location of solar farms to maximize energy generation while minimizing environmental and social impacts. Using advanced GIS techniques, our team has developed a multi-criteria evaluation framework to identify ideal sites for solar farm development.

The transition to renewable energy sources is a critical component of sustainable urban planning and climate change mitigation. Solar energy, in particular, offers immense potential but requires careful site selection to ensure economic viability, minimal ecological disruption, and community acceptance. Our project addresses this challenge by developing a data-driven approach to solar farm siting that balances technical, environmental, and social considerations.

Through the integration of multiple geospatial datasets including solar radiation, land use, topography, infrastructure proximity, and environmental sensitivity, we've created a sophisticated model that identifies optimal locations for solar farm development. Our analysis not only highlights prime locations but also quantifies potential energy generation capacity and evaluates potential constraints.

The findings from our project provide valuable insights for urban planners, energy developers, and policymakers seeking to expand renewable energy infrastructure while preserving ecological integrity and addressing community concerns.

## Key Objectives

1. Develop a comprehensive GIS-based framework for solar farm site selection
2. Identify and map optimal locations based on multiple technical and environmental criteria
3. Quantify potential solar energy generation capacity at identified sites
4. Analyze the environmental and social implications of proposed locations
5. Create interactive visualization tools to support planning decisions
