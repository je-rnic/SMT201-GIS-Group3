## Project Overview

Solarscape is a geospatial analysis project that identifies optimal solar farm locations by integrating multiple criteria such as solar radiation, land use, infrastructure proximity, and environmental constraints. Using **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** and QGIS, we developed a **scoring framework** to balance energy generation potential with ecological and social considerations.


### Key Insights

- **Initial Site Analysis**: Identify optimal locations using GIS-based spatial analysis with URA Master Plan 2019 data.
- **Land-Use Constraints**: Excluded high-rise urban areas, natural reserves, and offshore islands.
- **Environmental Criteria**: Scored using various factors i.e. Proximity to Substations, Aspect, Slope, Proximity to Roads, Temperature
- **Decision-Making Framework**: Applied **Quantitative MCDA Scoring** with suitability thresholds.
- **Post-MCDA Evaluation**: Utilised satellite images for visual inspection/analysis of suitable sites.
