## Project Overview

Solarscape is a geospatial analysis project that identifies optimal solar farm locations by integrating multiple criteria such as solar radiation, land use, infrastructure proximity, and environmental constraints. Using **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** and QGIS, we developed a **scoring framework** to balance energy generation potential with ecological and social considerations.

### Why Site Selection Matters

Solar energy is a key pillar of sustainable urban planning, but poor site selection can lead to high costs, inefficiencies, and environmental harm. Our **MCDA approach** evaluates critical factors—including **terrain aspect, slope, proximity to substations and roads**—to determine the best possible sites while avoiding **protected areas, tree conservation zones, and nature reserves**.

### Key Insights

- **Optimal sites**: Identified using GIS-based spatial analysis with URA Master Plan 2019 data.
- **Energy potential**: Estimated using solar radiation data from NASA’s POWER LARC.
- **Constraints**: Excluded high-rise urban areas, natural reserves, and offshore islands.
- **Decision-making framework**: Applied **quantitative MCDA scoring** with suitability thresholds.
