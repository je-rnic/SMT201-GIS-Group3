## Project Overview

Solarscape is a geospatial analysis project that identifies optimal solar farm locations by integrating multiple criteria such as solar radiation, land use, infrastructure proximity, and environmental constraints. Using **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** and QGIS, we developed a **scoring framework** to balance energy generation potential with ecological and social considerations.


### Key Insights

- **Optimal sites**: Identified using GIS-based spatial analysis with URA Master Plan 2019 data.
- **Energy potential**: Estimated using solar radiation data from NASAâ€™s POWER LARC.
- **Constraints**: Excluded high-rise urban areas, natural reserves, and offshore islands.
- **Decision-making framework**: Applied **quantitative MCDA scoring** with suitability thresholds.
