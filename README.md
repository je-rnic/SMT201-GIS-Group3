# SMT201-GIS-Group3

## Project Overview
Solarscape is a geospatial analysis project that identifies optimal solar farm locations by integrating multiple criteria. Using a **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** approach together with QGIS as our main Geospatial Analysis Tool, we developed a **scoring framework** to balance energy generation potential against ecological and social considerations.

## Key Insights

- **Initial Site Analysis**: Identify optimal locations using GIS-based spatial analysis with URA Master Plan 2019 data.
- **Land-Use Constraints**: Excluded urban areas such as residential and commercial zones, and unavailable areas such as natural reserves, protected areas and offshore islands.
- **Environmental Criteria**: Scored using various factors i.e. Proximity to Substations, Aspect, Slope, Proximity to Roads, Temperature
- **Decision-Making Framework**: Applied **Quantitative MCDA Scoring** with suitability thresholds.
- **Post-MCDA Evaluation**: Utilised satellite images for visual inspection/analysis of suitable sites.
