    "text": "Over the past decade, solar energy has emerged as the most viable renewable energy source for Singapore. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 targets a solar energy deployment of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030 to meet ~3% of projected electricity demand (Singapore 2021), yet the space required for solar farms (Bloomberg 2024) are not one where land-limited Singapore can generously afford.\nNotably, Sembcorp’s floating solar projects have demonstrated the potential of alternative installation methods, expanding solar capacity while providing critical insights into technical and operational challenges of water-based photovoltaic systems (Sembcorp, n.d.). Academic work on solar irradiance forecasting and clear-sky modeling in Singapore’s tropical climate has further enhanced site selection precision and energy yield predictions (Dev, Manandhar, and Lee 2017).\nThese studies collectively underscore that despite spatial limitations, strategic geospatial planning and supportive policy measures are crucial for Singapore’s transition to a low-carbon economy and long-term energy sustainability.\nThis report details our approach to using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodologies using GIS techniques, to identify viable locations for solar farms based on solar radiation, land use, and other infrastructure constraints."

Solar energy, in particular, offers immense potential but requires careful site selection to ensure economic viability, minimal ecological disruption, and community acceptance. Our project addresses this challenge by developing a data-driven approach to solar farm siting that balances technical, environmental, and social considerations.\nThrough the integration of multiple geospatial datasets including solar radiation, land use, topography, infrastructure proximity, and environmental sensitivity, we’ve created a sophisticated model that identifies optimal locations for solar farm development. Our analysis not only highlights prime locations but also quantifies potential energy generation capacity and evaluates potential constraints.\nThe findings from our project provide valuable insights for urban planners, energy developers, and policymakers seeking to expand renewable energy infrastructure while preserving ecological integrity and addressing community concerns.\nExplore Our GitHub Repository | View Project Poster | Download Full Report"
