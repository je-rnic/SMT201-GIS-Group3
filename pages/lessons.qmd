# Conclusion & Recommendations

Our GIS-based **MCDA framework** provides a **systematic approach** for identifying suitable solar farm locations. Future work could include:  
- Incorporating **real-world energy yield simulations**.  
- Refining **MCDA weighting** based on **expert feedback**.  
- Evaluating **policy and economic constraints** for large-scale deployment.
