Through this project, we have gotten many valuable insights, and in this section, we will be sharing more on what we learned, based on the different stages of our project.

## Research Phase:

During the research phase, we found that an estimated 36.4 km² of land area would be required just to meet 3% of Singapore’s projected energy demand in 2030\. This implies that even if the entire mainland were covered with solar panels, it would only be sufficient to meet approximately half of the country's energy needs. 

On the other hand, through our research, we also found that nuclear power is significantly more efficient when it comes to land use. For the same amount of electricity generated, a nuclear power plant can take up around 75 times less land than a solar farm and up to 360 times less than a wind farm ([The Nuclear Energy Institute, 2015](https://www.nei.org/news/2015/land-needs-for-wind-solar-dwarf-nuclear-plants)), which could be a crucial factor for a land-scarce country like Singapore. However, this advantage would only hold if we exclude all potential risks, such as health hazards and environmental risks etc. Hence, striking the balance is really crucial in maintaining a green energy supply in Singapore. 

## MCDA Analysis (Planning):

A lot of thoughts need to be put in during the planning stage of MCDA analysis, such as what data should we include (are we able to get the data?,  is the data useful?), and what are the AHP weights we should use to give us an accurate answer?

For example, during our planning stage, we planned to take in solar radiation data from different sources, but we quickly found out that due to Singapore's small land size, all of the free data sets we can get hold of simply group Singapore as one subarea, giving the entire Singapore the same solar radiation value. 

When we further explored different websites such as Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIES), we were able to get area specific solar radiation visualisation, but were unable to extract the values for our data analysis. The few figures below show example of the solar visualisation from different time periods:

With visualisation updating every 10 seconds on the website and the Min/Max points moving around the country constantly, our group concluded that this may not be the most crucial and accurate data we need and we should instead focus more on other data like proximity to substation, which we could get our hands on.

Furthermore, like other groups mentioned during the townhall presentation, with Singapore located along the equator, the solar radiation in Singapore may not differ drastically in the long run (throughout the entire lifespan of solar panels). Hence, our group did not include solar radiation as one of the main MCDA criterias.

## MCDA Analysis (Hands On):

When working with multi criteria on a different scale, e.g. proximity to substation, average temperature, it is almost always better to standardize the values, and put them on an equal scale e.g. 0-100 first, before reclassification to ensure the criterias are fairer.

Next, we also found out the importance of determining a logical and fair AHP weightage during our analysis process. For example, in our first iteration, we initially placed a really high weightage for aspect, as we thought that the direction the solar panel is facing would be the most crucial, as we want to maximise the “time-under-direct-sunlight”. While that is true, we quickly realised that we had given a fair higher weighting to aspect than we should have, as the MCDA output (prior to reclassification) looks incredibly similar to the aspect map, which does not provide us any insights to our analysis. 

### Iteration 1:

Blue Color: Non suitable areas (<50% of max score)
```

Through the figure above, it is clear that aspect was overweight in the AHP weight.   


### Iteration 2:

In the next iteration, we did further research into the importance of other criterias, and tried to rebalance the AHP weight based on our findings.

*Figure 5: Iteration 2 AHP Weights*

With this new AHP weights, we were able to achieve a much better result in our MCDA analysis. The figure below shows the output of our second iteration.

## Post MCDA Conclusion:

Lastly, our final takeaway (probably also the most important) is that while MCDA serves as a crucial multi criteria guideline for us to identify suitable areas, it **does not** always mean that it is definitely the most suitable area.

Very often, after we obtain the MCDA result, it is crucial that we also perform **visual analysis**, such as viewing the raster satellite images, which really give us a **full picture** of how the selected area looks like.

For example, in this project, one of the data that we weren't able to obtain/use was the height of surrounding buildings and the possible shadow they may cast on the selected sites. However, with the satellite images, we were able to get a much clearer picture, and conclude that our 3 selected sites had no skyscrapers or high rise buildings in the surrounding areas. 

Furthermore, with the satellite images itself, it also allows us to **pinpoint** many of the **potential advantages and disadvantages** of the site selected, at a very **early stage**.

For example, in the Lim Chu Kang site that was selected, while the location is really close to a substation and had a waterbody in close proximity, the satellite image was able to show that the vegetation in the area was well-maintained and likely not natural vegetation but managed vegetation.

With this, we were able to cross check with the OpenStreetMap layer and indeed the site selected is currently occupied by Warren Golf & Country club. This indicates that if the site were selected to be a solar farm, one of the **significant downsides** would be that the golf club would need to relocate to another area, which may present both **logistical challenges and potentially draw unfavorable feedback** from the community, especially from members of the golf club.

## Connecting Back to Singapore's Energy Challenge

The overall process and methodology developed in this project demonstrates how **sophisticated geospatial analysis** can help **overcome spatial constraints** through strategic site selection that considers **multiple factors simultaneously**. By integrating visual analysis with computational methods, we've created a more robust framework that *acknowledges both technical feasibility and practical implementation challenges*.

This holistic approach aligns perfectly with Singapore's need for careful planning in its transition to a low-carbon economy. As highlighted in our background research on Sembcorp's floating solar projects and academic forecasting models, innovative thinking about space utilization combined with precise technical analysis is essential for Singapore's energy sustainability goals.

By identifying specific sites like Lim Chu Kang, Choa Chu Kang, and Bahar – and thoroughly examining their practical viability beyond numerical scores – our project contributes valuable insights to Singapore's ongoing efforts to maximize renewable energy deployment despite its geographical limitations.
