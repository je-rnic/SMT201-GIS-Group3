## Meeting Minutes: Initial Project Discussion

**Date:** March 17, 2025  
**Time:** 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM  
**Attendees:** TOH Rui Chen, Chamus CHEW Yat Weng, Jernic YEO Jun Zhi  
**Subject:** Project Scoping for QGIS Solar Farm Analysis Assignment

### 1. Project Focus Decision

#### Initial Options Considered:
- Wind Farm Analysis
- Solar Farm Analysis

#### Points of Discussion:
- **Wind Farm Limitations:**
  - Limited existing wind turbine installations in Singapore
  - Space constraints for new installations
  - Inconsistent wind flow patterns in Singapore
  - Limited local data availability

- **Solar Farm Advantages:**
  - Greater prevalence of existing solar installations (observed on HDB rooftops)
  - Better data availability for solar installation capacities and locations
  - More opportunities for land use optimization analysis in QGIS
  - Alignment with Singapore's renewable energy initiatives

#### Decision:
After discussion, the team unanimously agreed to focus on Solar Farm analysis as the primary project direction.

### 2. Data Requirements and Acquisition

#### Required Datasets:
- **Land Use Data:**
  - Extract polygons with LU_DESC of Openspace, Waterbody & Reserved site
  - Avoid residential, special use, and built-up areas
  - Exclude natural reserves and parks

- **Topographical Data:**
  - Slope & DEM/aspect data from hands-on exercise
  - Solar radiance data from NASA's POWER LARC website (single point)

- **Infrastructure Data:**
  - Roads from OpenStreetMap (OSM), clipped with Singapore land use layer
  - Substation/electrical room locations via OpenStreetMap API (export as KML)
  - Environmental data (sunlight/temperature)

#### Data Collection Assignments:
- Rui Chen and Chamus to research and gather the identified datasets
- Team to refine specific data requirements as project progresses

### 3. Project Technical Setup

#### Requirements:
- GitHub repository for version control and collaboration
- A1 poster for presentation

#### GitHub Workflow Discussion:
- Jernic explained and introduced GitHub workflow version control for team members:
  - Capability to track various file types (code, Excel, CSV, etc.)
  - Basic workflow process: pull → make changes → commit → push
  - Importance of pulling before making changes to maintain synchronization
  - Recommendation to use GitHub Desktop application for easier management

#### Points of Disagreement and Resolution:

1. **Repository Structure:**
   - Rui Chen suggested organizing by data types
   - Chamus proposed organizing by project phases
   - **Resolution:** Agreed to use a hybrid approach with main folders for phases and subfolders for data types

2. **Website Platform:**
   - Jernic advocated for Quarto for its integration with R and markdown
   - Chamus suggested using WordPress for simpler management
   - **Resolution:** Selected Quarto to comply with assignment requirements and better technical documentation capabilities

3. **Data Analysis Approach:**
   - Rui Chen recommended focusing on available open spaces first
   - Jernic suggested a comprehensive approach analyzing all potential land types
   - **Resolution:** Decided to start with open spaces for initial analysis but develop a framework that could incorporate other land types if time permits

### 4. Division of Labor

#### Task Assignments:
- **Jernic:**
  - Set up the Quarto website
  - Configure GitHub repository and workflow
  - Develop visualization components

- **Rui Chen:**
  - Lead technical implementation of QGIS analysis
  - Gather and process land use and topographical data
  - Research solar efficiency parameters

- **Chamus:**
  - Collect infrastructure and environmental data
  - Process and configure scripts for data collection
  - Documentation and report writing


#### Assignment Considerations:
- Distribution based on technical strengths and previous experience
- Balanced workload across team members
- Cross-training opportunities to develop new skills


Meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.
