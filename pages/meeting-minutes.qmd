## Meeting Minutes 1: Initial Project Discussion

**Date:** March 17, 2025  
**Time:** 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM  
**Attendees:** TOH Rui Chen, Chamus CHEW Yat Weng, Jernic YEO Jun Zhi  
**Subject:** Project Scoping for QGIS Solar Farm Analysis Assignment

### 1. Project Focus Decision

#### Points of Discussion:
- **Initial Options Considered**: Wind Farm Analysis vs Solar Farm Analysis
- **Wind Farm Limitations:**
  - Limited existing wind turbine installations in Singapore
  - Space constraints for new installations
  - Inconsistent wind flow patterns in Singapore
  - Limited local data availability

- **Solar Farm Advantages:**
  - Greater prevalence of existing solar installations (observed on HDB rooftops)
  - Better data availability for solar installation capacities and locations
  - More opportunities for land use optimization analysis in QGIS
  - Alignment with Singapore's renewable energy initiatives

#### Decision:
- After discussion, the team unanimously agreed to focus on Solar Farm analysis as the primary project direction.

### 2. Data Requirements and Acquisition

#### Required Datasets:
- **Land Use Data:**
  - Extract polygons with LU_DESC of Openspace, Waterbody & Reserved site
  - Avoid residential, special use, and built-up areas
  - Exclude natural reserves and parks

- **Topographical Data:**
  - Slope & DEM/aspect data from hands-on exercise
  - Solar radiance data from NASA's POWER LARC website (single point)

- **Infrastructure Data:**
  - Roads from OpenStreetMap (OSM), clipped with Singapore land use layer
  - Substation/electrical room locations via OpenStreetMap API (export as KML)
  - Environmental data (sunlight/temperature)

#### Data Collection Assignments:
- Rui Chen and Chamus to research and gather the identified datasets
- Team to refine specific data requirements as project progresses

### 3. Project Technical Setup

#### Requirements:
- GitHub repository for version control and collaboration
- A1 poster for presentation

#### GitHub Workflow Discussion:
- Jernic explained and introduced GitHub workflow version control for team members:
  - Capability to track various file types (code, Excel, CSV, etc.)
  - Basic workflow process: pull → make changes → commit → push
  - Importance of pulling before making changes to maintain synchronization
  - Recommendation to use GitHub Desktop application for easier management

#### Points of Disagreement and Resolution:

1. **Repository Structure:**
   - Rui Chen suggested organizing by data types
   - Chamus proposed organizing by project phases
   - **Resolution:** Agreed to use a hybrid approach with main folders for phases and subfolders for data types

2. **Website Platform:**
   - Jernic advocated for Quarto for its integration with R and markdown
   - Chamus suggested using WordPress for simpler management
   - **Resolution:** Selected Quarto to comply with assignment requirements and better technical documentation capabilities

3. **Data Analysis Approach:**
   - Rui Chen recommended focusing on available open spaces first
   - Jernic suggested a comprehensive approach analyzing all potential land types
   - **Resolution:** Decided to start with open spaces for initial analysis but develop a framework that could incorporate other land types if time permits

### 4. Division of Labor

#### Task Assignments:
- **Jernic:**
  - Lead technical implementation of Project website using Quarto, HTML/SCSS and Javascript
  - Configure GitHub repository and workflow
  - Develop and integrate geospatial visualization components

- **Rui Chen:**
  - Lead technical implementation of QGIS analysis
  - Gather and process land use and topographical data
  - Research solar efficiency parameters

- **Chamus:**
  - Collect infrastructure and environmental data
  - Process and configure scripts for data collection
  - Documentation and report writing


#### Assignment Considerations:
- Distribution based on technical strengths and previous experience
- Balanced workload across team members
- Cross-training opportunities to develop new skills


Meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.



## Meeting Minutes 2: Final Project Submission Update & Review

**Date:** April 14, 2025  
**Time:** 1.30 PM  
**Attendees:** TOH Rui Chen, Chamus CHEW Yat Weng, Jernic YEO Jun Zhi  
**Subject:** Finalization of QGIS Solar Farm Analysis Project Deliverables

### Agenda Items Discussed

### 1. Submission Components Finalization

**a. Meeting Minutes Documentation**

* Reviewed and finalized all previous meeting minutes for clarity, completeness, and formatting consistency.

* Decided to include all minutes as part of the appendix in the final report submission.

* Chamus assigned to compile and format all minutes into a single PDF document.

**b. Project Artifacts**

* Confirmed the inclusion of the following items as core artifacts:

  * QGIS project files (.qgz)

  * Processed datasets (e.g., land use polygons, slope, aspect, solar radiation)

  * Code scripts used for data preparation and visualization

  * Maps and analysis outputs

* Rui Chen ensured all QGIS outputs were properly labeled and exported.

* All datasets were cross-verified for source referencing and accuracy.

**c. Project Website (Quarto)**

* Jernic completed final formatting and design of the project website.

* Confirmed all required sections were included: Introduction, Methodology, Analysis, Findings, Reflections, and References.

* Interactive visualizations embedded successfully.

* Website published and link submitted to the assignment portal.

**d. Peer Evaluation for Other Groups**

* Group discussed evaluation criteria (e.g., clarity, technical depth, visual design, innovation).

* Each member assigned to evaluate one peer group project fairly and independently.

* Evaluation forms to be submitted individually via the school portal by tonight.


### 2. Final Quality Checks

* Ran through a checklist of deliverables against the assignment brief.

* Verified file naming conventions, versioning in GitHub, and metadata completeness.

* All materials uploaded to shared GitHub repository and backed up on cloud storage.


### 3. Reflections and Wrap-Up

* Team reflected on project experience, challenges, and key learning outcomes:

  * Improved proficiency in QGIS and spatial analysis

  * Experience using GitHub for team collaboration

  * Exposure to real-world data handling and solar energy planning

* Noted strong teamwork and communication throughout the project


Meeting adjourned at approximately 3:00 PM.
