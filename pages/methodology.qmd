# 1. Getting Started

## 1.1 Creating the Project Folder

Create a new project folder called GIS_Metafolder or any name of your choice. In here we will save the raw datasets to be processed before it's added into our main QGIS project layers.

Create a new sub-folder called QGIS or any name of your choice. This will be where you save the direct project draft file and other data package related documents.

## 1.2 Downloading the Data Sets

The datasets we've used are:

1. Download the data sets,
2. Place them in the newly created GIS_Metafolder sub-folder, and
3. Unzip them


## 1.3 Start a new QGIS Project

1. Launch QGIS 3.40.2 
2. Start a new QGIS project.
3. Save the project in GIS_Metafolder/QGIS folder. Name the project any name of your choice.
