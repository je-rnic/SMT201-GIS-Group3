## Data Cleaning & Preparation


Our analysis follows a **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** approach to rank potential sites.  

### **Step 1: Defining Suitability Criteria**
We evaluated each site based on **four key factors**:  
- **Aspect (Sun exposure based on direction)**  
- **Slope (Flat or gentle slopes preferred)**  
- **Proximity to substations (Lower transmission costs for closer sites)**  
- **Proximity to roads (Easier transportation & maintenance access)**  

### **Step 2: Assigning Weights & Scores**
Each factor was assigned a **suitability score (1-5)**. The final suitability score was computed using a weighted overlay approach.

### **Step 3: Applying Constraints**
- **Excluded** natural reserves, tree conservation areas, and offshore islands.  
- Applied **threshold-based filtering** to remove areas below **50% suitability score**.  

# Results & Findings

- The **highest-scoring areas** were in **[specific regions, based on your map results]**.  
- Some **unexpected patterns** emerged due to weight distributions in the MCDA.  
- Further refinements may be needed, especially in **aspect weighting**.

# Limitations

- **Data accuracy**: Some datasets, especially **substation locations**, may contain missing information.  
- **Weighting sensitivity**: Small changes in scoring weights significantly affect the results.  
- **Policy constraints**: Future changes in land use zoning may impact site feasibility.  

# Conclusion & Recommendations

Our GIS-based **MCDA framework** provides a **systematic approach** for identifying suitable solar farm locations. Future work could include:  
- Incorporating **real-world energy yield simulations**.  
- Refining **MCDA weighting** based on **expert feedback**.  
- Evaluating **policy and economic constraints** for large-scale deployment.
