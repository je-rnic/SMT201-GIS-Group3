# 1. Getting Started

## 1.1 Creating the Project Folder

- Create a new project folder called GIS_Metafolder or any name of your choice. In here we will save the raw datasets to be processed before it's added into our main QGIS project layers.

- Create a new sub-folder called QGIS or any name of your choice. This will be where you save the direct project draft file and other data package related documents.

## 1.2 Downloading the Data Sets

The datasets we've used can be found at [Data](report.qmd#data)

1. Download the data sets,
2. Place them in the newly created GIS_Metafolder sub-folder, and
3. Unzip them


## 1.3 Start a new QGIS Project

1. Launch QGIS 3.40.2 
2. Start a new QGIS project.
3. Save the project in GIS_Metafolder/QGIS folder. Name the project any name of your choice.



# 2. Extraction of Areas

## 2.1 Geoprocessing MP19 Subzone

### 2.1.1 Vector Difference Tool

1. Extract the Mainland Subzone:

    - Begin by isolating the MP19 subzone from the dataset.
    - Filter out open spaces, reserved areas, water bodies, and remove surrounding islands (e.g., Tekong, Ubin) to retain only the main island of Singapore.

2. Remove Restricted Areas:

    - Use the Vector Difference tool to subtract polygons representing:

        - Tree conservation zones (NPARKS)
        - Nature reserves (NPARKS)
        - Protected areas (MHA)

3. Output:

    - The resulting layer, named viable_areas, will include only those areas that are available and allowed for solar panel installation.


## 2.2 Analysis of Aspatial Data

### 2.2.1 Python Processing of Temperature Data

1. Temperature Data Extraction:

    - Use Python scripting within QGIS or an external Python environment to process the temperature dataset.
    - Calculate the average temperature for each weather station over a period of 180 days.

2. Output:

    - Generate a point layer representing weather stations with an attribute field for average temperature.


## 2.3 Combining of Temperature to Viable Areas

1. Spatial Join:

    - Link the temperature point layer to the viable_areas layer by performing a spatial join.
    - Ensure each polygon inherits the nearest weather station’s average temperature.

2. Validation:

    - Verify that each polygon now includes an attribute for average temperature to be used in later analysis steps.



# 3. Proximity Analysis

## 3.1 Extracting Substation Locations

1. API Extraction:
    - Use the OpenStreetMap API (or an equivalent source) to extract the locations of all substations in Singapore.

2. Resulting Layer:
    - Save the substation locations as a point layer. This will be used for proximity analysis in later steps.


## 3.2 Slope

1. DEM Analysis:
    - Load a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the study area.

2. Generate Slope Layer:
    - Use the QGIS Slope tool (typically found under Raster > Terrain Analysis) to derive a slope layer from the DEM.

3. Output:
    - The slope layer is crucial for determining areas that are more suitable for solar panel installations.


## 3.3 Aspect 
1. Generate Aspect Layer:
    - With the DEM loaded, apply the QGIS Aspect Tool found under Raster > Analysis > Aspect.
    - This tool calculates the direction that slopes face, which can influence solar efficiency.

2. Output:
    - Save the resulting aspect layer for further processing.

## 3.4 Rasterising layers

1. Raster Conversion:
    - Convert key vector layers (e.g., substations, roads, and other critical infrastructure) into raster format.

2. Method:
    - Use QGIS’s Rasterize (Vector to Raster) tool, ensuring that the resolution and alignment match your other spatial datasets.

3. Purpose:
    - Rasterizing these layers facilitates the overlay and proximity analysis in later steps.


## 3.5 Creating proximity map for Roads and Substation
1. Proximity Analysis
    - For each rasterized vector layer (roads and substations), generate a proximity map.
    - Use QGIS’s Proximity (Raster Distance) tool to compute distance from each pixel to the nearest feature (road or substation).

2. Output:
    - These proximity maps will be reclassified and weighted as part of the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).



# 4. Analytical Hierachy Process

## 4.1 Criteria
- The criteria for solar farm suitability assessment include:
    - Slope: Areas with gentle slopes are preferable.
    - Aspect: East/West-facing slopes may be more beneficial depending on solar path.
    - Proximity to Roads: Accessibility is a key factor.
    - Proximity to Substations: Easier connection to the grid is desired.
    - Temperature: As higher temperatures may affect solar efficiency, reclassifying temperature data ensures accurate assessments.


## 4.2 Standardization

![](/images/standard.png){width=400px}

All layers except for aspect was standardised using the formula above, using raster calculator, into a scale of onto a scale of 0-100


## 4.3 AHP Weighting

![](/images/lessons/image6.png)

Apply the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to assign weights to each of the criteria. Initially, the aspect criterion may have been over-weighted, so adjust the weights to balance the influence of all layers.

## 4.4 Reclassification:

1. Aspect:

    - Analyze the aspect layer to determine which orientations receive higher solar exposure
    - Reclassify the aspect values so that slopes facing the optimal direction for solar capture (as per your local conditions and guidelines) receive a higher suitability score.

    Aspect Scoring Table used for this analysis:


    | Aspect Range | Direction | Score | Rationale |
    |---------|-------|-----|--------------|
    | 0°–72° | North-East | 2 | Captures early morning sunlight but less optimal |
    | 72°–144° | East | 5 | Optimal for capturing morning sunlight, aligning with peak energy demand |
    | 144°–216° | South | 4 | Good exposure; consistent performance throughout the day in equatorial regions |
    | 216°–288° | West | 5 | Optimal for capturing afternoon sunlight, offsetting evening energy demand |
    | 288°–360° | North-West | 1 | Lowest solar exposure due to indirect sunlight in tropical regions |




2. Other Layers:

    Reclassify all standardised layers using a fixed range to provide a unbiased analysis


    | Standardised Range | Score |
    |--------------------|-------|
    | 0 - 20 | 1 |
    | 20 - 40 | 2 |
    | 40 - 60 | 3 |
    | 60 - 80 | 4 |
    | 80 - 100 | 5 |


## 4.5 Final MCDA Map Creation

Add up all the (reclassified layer * AHP weight) to produce a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) map using raster calculator.

After performing the above raster calculation, the resulting MCDA map was reclassified based on their total MCDA scores to identify areas of varying suitability. A threshold is then applied—for instance, selecting areas with scores of 3.75 and above (75% of the maximum score of 5)—to delineate zones considered suitable for solar farm development.

    | Total MCDA Range | Score |
    |--------------------|-------|
    | >=3.75 (75th percentile) | 1 (Suitable) |
    | <3.75  | 0 (Unsuitable) |

4. Validation and Iteration:

    - Review the MCDA output. If areas that are classified as suitable (blue) or unsuitable (yellow) do not align with realistic expectations, iteratively refine the weights and reclassification schemes.

    - Consider additional factors or alternative reclassification thresholds until the output map reliably indicates viable areas for solar panel installations.
