# Introduction

Over the past decade, solar energy has emerged as the most viable renewable energy source for Singapore. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 targets a solar energy deployment of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030 to meet ~3% of projected electricity demand [@greenplan2030], yet the space required for solar farms [@solarfarmspace] are not one where land-limited Singapore can generously afford.

Notably, Sembcorp's floating solar projects have demonstrated the potential of alternative installation methods, expanding solar capacity while providing critical insights into technical and operational challenges of water-based photovoltaic systems [@sembcorp]. Academic work on solar irradiance forecasting and clear-sky modeling in Singapore's tropical climate has further enhanced site selection precision and energy yield predictions [@irradiance2023]. 

These studies collectively underscore that despite spatial limitations, strategic technological innovations and supportive policy measures are crucial for Singapore's transition to a low-carbon economy and long-term energy sustainability.

This report details our approach to using **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** methodologies using GIS techniques, to **identify viable locations** for solar farms based on solar radiation, land use, and other infrastructure constraints.

# Objectives

- Identify **highly suitable locations** for solar farm installation in Singapore.  
- Integrate **geospatial datasets** to perform **spatial analysis** and **MCDA ranking**.  
- Exclude **unsuitable areas** such as **protected areas, high-rise zones, and natural reserves**.  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for urban planners and policymakers.

# Data Sources & Preprocessing

We used **QGIS** for data integration, preprocessing, and analysis. The primary datasets include:  

- **Solar radiation data** (NASA POWER LARC)  
- **Land use data** (URA Master Plan 2019)  
- **Roads and infrastructure** (OpenStreetMap)  
- **Substation locations** (Extracted from OpenStreetMap API)  
- **Environmental constraints** (Nature reserves, conservation zones)  
- **Topographic data** (Slope, Aspect, Digital Elevation Model)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

To be filled up
<!-- 1. **Filtering Land Use**: Extracted only **Openspace, Waterbody, and Reserved** land use zones.  
2. **Proximity Analysis**: Calculated distances from **substations** and **major roads**.  
3. **Topographic Processing**: Derived **slope and aspect** layers from the **DEM dataset**.  
4. **Final Dataset**: Combined and clipped layers to retain only **suitable areas**. -->
