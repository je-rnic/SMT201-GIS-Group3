# Introduction and Motivation

Over the past decade, solar energy has emerged as the most viable renewable energy source for Singapore. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 targets a solar energy deployment of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030 to meet ~3% of projected electricity demand [@greenplan2030], yet the space required for solar farms [@solarfarmspace] are not one where land-limited Singapore can generously afford.

Notably, Sembcorp's floating solar projects have demonstrated the potential of alternative installation methods, expanding solar capacity while providing critical insights into technical and operational challenges of water-based photovoltaic systems [@sembcorp]. Academic work on solar irradiance forecasting and clear-sky modeling in Singapore's tropical climate has further enhanced site selection precision and energy yield predictions [@irradiance2023]. 

These studies collectively underscore that despite spatial limitations, strategic technological innovations and supportive policy measures are crucial for Singapore's transition to a low-carbon economy and long-term energy sustainability.

This report details our approach to using **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** methodologies using GIS techniques, to **identify viable locations** for solar farms based on solar radiation, land use, and other infrastructure constraints.

# Objectives

- Identify **highly suitable locations** for solar farm installation in Singapore.  
- Integrate **geospatial datasets** to perform **spatial analysis** and **MCDA ranking**.  
- Exclude **unsuitable areas** such as **protected areas, high-rise zones, and natural reserves**.  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for urban planners and policymakers.

# Data

We used **QGIS 3.40.2** for data integration, preprocessing, and analysis. The primary datasets include:  

- **Land use data** (URA Master Plan 2019)  
- **Topographic data** (Slope, Aspect, Digital Elevation Model)
- **Environmental data** (Temperature)
- **Substation locations** (Extracted from OpenStreetMap API)
- **Roads and infrastructure** (OpenStreetMap)  
- **Solar radiation data** (NASA POWER LARC)  


# Scope of Work

Refer to [Methodology](methodology.qmd) for a full step-by-step guide to our project set-up.


## Site Suitability Analysis

- Identification and extraction of viable areas on Singapore's mainland by excluding restricted zones (nature reserves, tree conservation areas, protected areas, military zones etc.)
- Development of suitability criteria based on physical, environmental, and infrastructural factors


## Data Processing and Integration

- Preprocessing of geospatial data from multiple sources (URA Master Plan 2019, OpenStreetMap, NPARKS)
- Rasterization of vector layers for consistent analysis
- Generation of derived datasets (slope, aspect, proximity maps)
- Standardization of criteria values to a common scale (0-100) to facilitate comparison


## Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis

- Implementation of standardization-first approach for proximity, slope, and temperature factors
- Reclassification of standardized values using structured scoring tables
- Integration of AHP weightages for balanced criteria evaluation
- Calculation of composite suitability scores and identification of optimal sites


## Visualization and Interpretation

- Creation of suitability maps highlighting the most viable locations (top quartile)
- Analysis of spatial patterns and key determinants of suitability
- Identification of trade-offs between competing factors (e.g., proximity to infrastructure vs. environmental conditions)


## Validation and Refinement

- Sensitivity analysis of AHP weightings to assess robustness
- Refinement of methodology based on preliminary results and expert feedback
- Comparison of results using different analytical approaches (standardize-then-classify vs. classify-then-standardize)
