# Introduction and Motivation

Over the past decade, solar energy has emerged as the most viable renewable energy source for Singapore. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 targets a solar energy deployment of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030 to meet ~3% of projected electricity demand [@greenplan2030], yet the space required for solar farms [@solarfarmspace] are not one where land-limited Singapore can generously afford.

Notably, Sembcorp's floating solar projects have demonstrated the potential of alternative installation methods, expanding solar capacity while providing critical insights into technical and operational challenges of water-based photovoltaic systems [@sembcorp]. Academic work on solar irradiance forecasting and clear-sky modeling in Singapore's tropical climate has further enhanced site selection precision and energy yield predictions [@irradiance2023]. 

These studies collectively underscore that despite spatial limitations, strategic geospatial planning and supportive policy measures are crucial for Singapore's transition to a low-carbon economy and long-term energy sustainability.

This report details our approach to using **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** methodologies using GIS techniques, to identify viable locations for solar farms based on solar radiation, land use, and other infrastructure constraints.

# Objectives

- Scope out initial **suitable locations** for solar farm installation in Singapore.  
- Filter out **non-ideal locations** such as **protected areas, high-rise zones, and natural reserves etc.**.  
- Integrate **geospatial datasets** to perform **spatial analysis** and **MCDA ranking**.  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for urban planners and policymakers.

# Data

We used **QGIS 3.40.2** for data integration, preprocessing, and analysis. The primary datasets include:  

## Downloaded from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/)

- [Master Plan 2019 Land Use layer](https://data.gov.sg/collections/1646/view):  
  - This dataset provides detailed information on land use classifications as per the 2019 Master Plan.

- [Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)](https://data.gov.sg/collections/1749/view):  
  - This layer delineates subzone boundaries excluding maritime areas, as outlined in the 2019 Master Plan.

## Downloaded from [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/): 

- [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)](https://gisgeography.com/srtm-shuttle-radar-topography-mission/):
  - 30-meter digital elevation model data. This high-resolution topographic data is crucial for terrain analysis and modeling. The STRM data set is already provided in the hands-on exercise data folder by the professor

## Downloaded from [Geofabrik download server](https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei.html):
  - Roads and buildings data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei data sets. 
  - These datasets include vector data representing road networks and building footprints, sourced from the collaborative OpenStreetMap project.      

## Processed from [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/): 
  - We wrote a query script (code located in substation_query.txt) and ran it in the Openstreetmap Overpass Turbo API site, to retrieve the the substation location in Singapore, before exporting as KML.
  - The KML contains a polygon and point layer, and the polygon was further converted to point using **centroid** and combined with the point layer using **Merge Vector Layers**. 
  - All fields except for Name, Fid, addr_postcode and addr_street was removed, before saving in geopackage as **substation_location**.

# Scope of Work

Refer to [Methodology](methodology.qmd) for a full step-by-step guide to our project set-up.


- **Site Suitability Analysis**: Identify viable areas by excluding restricted zones and applying suitability criteria.
- **Data Processing and Integration**: Preprocess geospatial data, rasterize layers, and generate derived datasets (e.g., slope, aspect, proximity maps).
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis**: Standardize, reclassify, and weight criteria to calculate composite suitability scores.
- **Visualization and Interpretation**: Create suitability maps, analyze spatial patterns, and identify trade-offs between factors.
- **Validation and Refinement**: Perform sensitivity analysis, refine methods, and compare analytical approaches.
